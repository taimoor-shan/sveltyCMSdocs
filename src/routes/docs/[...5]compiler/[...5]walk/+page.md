# Walk

```js
walk(ast: Node, {
	enter(node: Node, parent: Node, prop: string, index: number)?: void,
	leave(node: Node, parent: Node, prop: string, index: number)?: void
})
```

The `walk` function provides a way to walk the abstract syntax trees generated by the parser, using the compiler's own built-in instance of [estree-walker](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/estree-walker).

The walker takes an abstract syntax tree to walk and an object with two optional methods: `enter` and `leave`. For each node, `enter` is called (if present). Then, unless `this.skip()` is called during `enter`, each of the children are traversed, and then `leave` is called on the node.

```js
const svelte = require('svelte/compiler');
svelte.walk(ast, {
  enter(node, parent, prop, index) {
    do_something(node);
    if (should_skip_children(node)) {
      this.skip();
    }
  },
  leave(node, parent, prop, index) {
    do_something_else(node);
  },
});
```
